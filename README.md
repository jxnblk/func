This is an experiment in attempting to create a super-perfomant, JavaScript-only site.
The `index.html` file consists of a Doctype declaration and a single script tag.
The `index.js` file includes functions for rending DOM elements and all the content on the site.

Note: this site uses ES2015 features that only work in the latest browsers.
